The way in which user accounts and access permissions are handeld in Singularity containers is very different from that in Docker (where you effectively always have superuser/root access). When running a Singularity container, you only have the same permissions to access files as the user you are running as on the hots system.

## Users within a Singularity container

The first thing to note is that when you run `whoami` within the container you should see the username that you are signed in as on the host system when you run the container. For example, if my username is `jc1000`:

~~~
$ singularity shell hello-world.sif
Singularity> whoami
jc1000
~~~
{: .language-bash}

But hang on! I downloaded the standard, public version of the `hello-world.sif` image from Singularity Hub. I haven't customised it in any way. How is it configured with my own user details?!

If you have any familiarity with Linux system administration, you may be aware that in Linux, users and their Unix groups are configured in the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` files respectively. In order for the shell within the container to know of my user, the relevant user information needs to be available within these files within the container.

Assuming this feature is enabled on your system, when the container is started, Singularity appends the relevant user and group lines from the host system to the `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group` files within the container [\[1\]](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/presentation/hpc-containers-singularity-advanced.pdf).

This means that the host system can effectively ensure that you cannot access any data you should not be able to on the host system and you cannot run anything that you would not have permission to run on the host system.

## Files and directories within a Singularity container

Singularity also _binds_ some directories from the host system where you are running the `singularity` command into the container that you're starting. Note that this bind process is not copying files into the running container, it is making an existing directory on the host system visible and accessible within the container environment. If you write files to this directory within the running container, when the container shuts down, those changes will persist in the relevant location on the host system.

There is a default configuration of which files and directories are bound into the container but ultimate control of how things are set up on the system where you are running Singularity is determined by the system administrator. As a result, this section provides an overview but you may find that things are a little different on the system that you're running on.

Two directories that are likely to be accessible within a container that you start are your _home directory_ and the directory from which you issued the `singularity` command (the _current working directory_).

The mapping of file content and directories from a host system into a Singularity container is illustrated in the example below showing a subset of the directories on the host Linux system and in a Singularity container:

~~~
Host system:                                                      Singularity container:
-------------                                                     ----------------------
/                                                                 /
├── bin                                                           ├── bin

> ## Questions and exercises: Files in Singularity containers
>
> **Q1:** What do you notice about the ownership of files in a container started from the hello-world image? (e.g. take a look at the ownership of files in the root directory (`/`))
> 
> **Exercise 1:** In this container, try editing (for example using the editor `vi` which should be avaiable in the container) the `/rawr.sh` file. What do you notice?
>
> _If you're not familiar with `vi` there are many quick reference pages online showing the main commands for using the editor, for example [this one](http://web.mit.edu/merolish/Public/vi-ref.pdf)._
> 
> **Exercise 2:** In your home directory within the container shell, try and create a simple text file. Is it possible to do this? If so, why? If not, why not?! If you can successfully create a file, what happens to it when you exit the shell and the container shuts down?
>
> > ## Answers
> >
> > **A1:** Use the `ls -l` command to see a detailed file listing including file ownership and permission details. You should see that all the files are owned by you. This looks good - you should be ready to edit something in the exercise that follows...
> >
> > **A Ex1:** Unfortunately, it's not so easy, depending on how you tried to edit `/rawr.sh` you probably saw an error similar to the following: `Can't open file for writing` or `Read-only file system`
> > 
> > **A Ex2:** Within your home directory, you _should_ be able to successfully create a file. Since you're seeing your home directory on the host system which has been bound into the container, when you exit and the container shuts down, the file that you created within the container should still be present when you look at your home directory on the host system.

## Binding additional host system directories to the container

You will sometimes need to bind additional host system directories into a container you are using over and above those bound by default. For example:

- There may be a shared dataset in a shard location that you need access to in the container
- You may require executables and software libraries in the container (we will see an example of this later when we need to make the MPI library on the system available in the container)

The `-B` option to the `singularity` command is used to specify additonal binds. For example, to bind the `/work/z19/shared` directory (note this directory may not exist on the host system you are using so you may need to choose something else) into a container you could use:

```
$ singularity shell -B /work/z19/shared hello-world.sif
Singularity> ls /work/z19/shared
```
{: .language-bash}
```

```

Note that, by default, a bind is mounted at the same path in the container as on the host system. You can also specify where a host directory is mounted in the container by separating the host path from the container path by a colon (`:`) in the option:

```
$ singularity shell -B /work/z19/shared:/shared-data hello-world.sif
Singularity> ls -l /shared-data
```
{: .language-bash}
```

```
{: .output}

You can also specify multiple binds to `-B` by separating them by commas (`,`).

You can also copy data into a container image at build time if there is some static data required in the image. We cover this later in the seciton on building Singularity containers.
