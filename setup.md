If you are attending a taught version of this lesson, it is likely that the course organisers will provide access to a platform with Singularity and MPI pre-installed for undertaking parts of the lesson. You may be required to undertake an account registration process in order to gain access this platform. The course organisers will provide details in advance.

Beyond any account registration that may be required and the prerequisites described on the main lesson page, there is no further lesson setup to complete.
